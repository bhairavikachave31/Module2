About Loops and if-else statement

# Assignment 2 - Module 3: Control Structures in Python

This assignment contains two tasks demonstrating the use of control structures (`if-else` and loops) in Python.

---

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### Expected Learning Outcomes

Understanding conditional statements (if-else) in Python.
Using loops (for) to iterate over ranges.
Performing basic arithmetic operations in Python.
